## ACTools: Core
<p>
  This package contains core parts to ACTools packages. This includes things like extension methods, custom attributes, and dependencies for other ACTools that are made.
  The goal of this repo is to serve as a hub for my preferred utility scripts that I add to just about any Unity Project. It also serves as a bases for other tools/library I make.

  Feel free to use it for whatever. If you wouldn't mind, please credit me. It would be appreciated!
